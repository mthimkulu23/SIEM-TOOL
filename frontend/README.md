# SIEM-TOOL Frontend
This directory contains the web-based user interface for the SIEM-TOOL.
It's built with HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity.

# Project Structure
public/: Contains the main index.html file and any static assets.

src/: Source files for JavaScript and CSS.

main.js: Main application logic for the dashboard.

api.js: Handles communication with the backend API.

utils.js: Reusable utility functions.

main.css: Custom CSS styles (if any, beyond Tailwind).

# Development
To run this frontend, you typically need to serve the public/ directory via a simple HTTP server (e.g., Python's http.server or a live server extension in your IDE).

Make sure the backend API is running concurrently for full functionality.
