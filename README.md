# SIEM-TOOL
This project aims to build a conceptual Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool.

It includes a Python backend for log processing, anomaly detection, and database interaction (MongoDB),

and a modern web frontend for real-time monitoring and analysis.

# Project Structure
backend/: Contains all server-side Python logic.

frontend/: Contains all client-side web assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

scripts/: Utility scripts for development tasks.

.env: Environment variables for configuration (e.g., database URIs).

requirements.txt: Python dependencies.

# Setup & Installation
Detailed instructions on how to set main.js
touch api.js
touch utils.js
touch main.css
cd .. # Go back to frontend/
cd .. # Go back to siem_project/

# 4. Create scripts directory and files
mkdir scripts
cd scripts
touch setup_db.py
touch run_tests.py
cd .. # Go back to siem_project/

# 5. Create top-level files
touch environment.yml # Or requirements.txt
touch .env
touch README.md

echo "SIEM project structure created successfully!"


After running these commands, you will have an empty directory structure ready for you to start adding code to each file. You can verify the structure by using ls -R inside the siem_project directory.
